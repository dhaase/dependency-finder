Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>JDK</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>1.5.0_04 (?)</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>1.8.0_172</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ant</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>1.9.7</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>1.10.1</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

I don't know when it started, but the default Ant target no longer works.
These three invocation all do the same thing:

    ant
    ant all
    ant distclean dist

Both =distclean= and =dist= depend on the =init= target, which sets a bunch of
variables and creates output folders.  But `distclean` deletes these output
folders so they no longer exist by the time `dist` runs.

I tried to generate a new release, =1.2.1-beta5=.  However, I am now using Java
8 and it generates =.class= files that older versions of Java will not be able
to execute.  I wonder if that wil be a problem.

The instructions for generating a build need some updating.
