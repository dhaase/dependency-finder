Aborting efforts to convert to Grails, for now.

Grails 3.2.9 just came out, and this project is still on Grails 1.3.7.  One the
one side, there is no obvious upgrade path for Grails apps out of 1.x.  And,
I never really got around to do anything major, yet.  So, I surrendered and
deleted the =grails= branch; I'd have to start over anyway and there wasn't much
to salvage anyway.
