Aborting efforts to convert to Grails.  For the time being.

Grails 3.2.9 just came out and this project is still on Grails 1.3.7!  There is
no obvious upgrade path for Grails apps out of 1.x.  And I never really got
around to do anything substantive.  So, I am giving up and deleting the =grails=
branch.  I'd have to start over anyway, and there isn't much to salvage.
